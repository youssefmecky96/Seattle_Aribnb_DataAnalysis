## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>
This project follows the CRISP-DM process 

For this project, I was interestested in using Seattle Airbnb data  to better understand:

1.Which neighborhoods had the most listings ?
2.Did the number of reviews and the score value of the review affect the price ?
3.How well can we predict the price of a listing and what factors do affect the price ?




## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There is 1 notebooks  here to showcase work related to the above questions.  . Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  
I try to make the analysis more of a story as you can see in the notebook to make more intresting and easier to follow 

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@youssef.mecky96/your-guide-to-list-an-apartment-in-seattle-on-airbnb-736d842d3967).

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements<a name="licensing"></a>
